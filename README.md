# Third-Person Exploration Game (Unity)

## Overview
A third-person exploration game prototype built in Unity where the player can freely navigate an outdoor environment and explore a simple structure. 
The project focuses on movement, animation, and environment setup rather than combat, emphasizing player control and world interaction.

## Features
- Third-person character controller
- Walking, running, and jumping mechanics
- Character animations with Animator state transitions
- Custom environment with terrain, trees, and a player-built house
- Physics-based movement and collision

## Tech Stack
- Engine: Unity
- Language: C#
- Animation: Unity Animator Controller
- Tools: Unity Editor, GitHub

## What I Learned
- Implementing third-person player movement and jump mechanics
- Setting up and managing animation states (Idle, Walk, Run, Jump)
- Working with Animator transitions and parameters
- Designing and assembling a basic 3D environment
- Debugging movement, animation timing, and collision issues

## Status
In progress — actively expanding the environment and refining movement and animation behavior.
